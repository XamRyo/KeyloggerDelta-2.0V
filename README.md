# **KeyloggerDelta v2.0** - **An Open-Source Keylogger**
A simple yet powerful Python-based keylogger with an ethical focus. Open Source - MIT License. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! - **XamRyo**

---

## **Ethical and Open-Source**
This repository contains a simple keylogger implemented in Python for **educational purposes only**. It is designed to demonstrate how keylogging works and should be used **responsibly**. Unauthorized use of this software may violate privacy laws and is strictly prohibited.

---

## **‚ú® Features**

- **Captures and logs keypresses with Keyboard Event Handling:**
  - The `OnKeyboardEvent` function processes keyboard events, logs the key presses to a specified file, and provides additional information such as the window name and window handle.
  
- **Destination Folder Definition:**
  - The keylogger stores data in a user-defined destination folder, specified by the `destination_folder` variable.
  
- **Timeout Mechanism:**
  - The script waits a set time (in seconds) before sending an email. The `TimeOut` function checks whether the timeout has been reached and triggers the sending of captured data.

- **Email Notification:**
  - The `SendEmail` function reads captured data from the log file, formats it, and sends it via email using the SMTP protocol. The `createEmail` function handles email creation and transmission.

- **Hook Manager Setup:**
  - The code uses the **pyHook** library to capture keyboard events through a hook manager.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The main loop checks for timeout and sends the captured data via email. It continuously processes any waiting messages.
