## 🛡️ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you stumble across a bug or security issue, I’d love to hear about it so we can patch it up quickly. Please follow these steps to report responsibly:

### 1. **Reach Out Privately**
- 📧 Send any questions or issues: **[Pull Requests]**  
- Use the subject: **"Security Vulnerability Report - Ethical Keylogger"**  

I promise to check my inbox faster as i can 😉

### 2. **What to Include**
Help me understand the issue by providing:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Clear steps to reproduce the problem.
- How the vulnerability could potentially be exploited.

### 3. **Responsible Disclosure**
- Please don’t post the vulnerability publicly before giving me a chance to investigate and fix it.  
- I’ll work on resolving it as quickly as possible—think of it as leveling up our project! 💪  
- If you’re okay with it, I’d love to credit you as a contributor when the issue is resolved.
